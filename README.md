How poorly can you get the various integration methods to perform?
- These integrands can perform poorly depending on the fucntion being integrated. I noticed that with oscilating functions, all three methods produce large realtive error. I also see that functions with discrepencies like endpoint singularaties, discontinuities and spikes causes the error to increase for these methods. 

The function that I decided to show that quadrature method failed was f(x)= sin(x). This function caused the Gaussian method to have higher error than the other two methods. Idon't know if it was a problem with my code or if Gaussian quadrature could not integrate with efficiency. I did think that it would have been no problem for Gaussian since it uses parabolas to solve the integrals and sin(x) is very close to a parabola shape.
